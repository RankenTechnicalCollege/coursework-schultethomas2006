            <p>Hello! My name is Thomas. I am currently 18 years old, and my birthday is
            in November. I built my current computer back in April with this course
            in mind as well as for personal use. It has an Intel Core i9-14900KF, 64 GB DDR5 RAM,
            a 2TB NVMe, and an RTX 4060 Super (Originally wanted a 5090, but never bothered getting it).
            I've liked computers and playing games since I was in 2nd grade, and more recently
            I acquired an interest in cars.</p>

            <p>Here are some things I enjoy doing:</p>
            <ul>
               <li>Going to the gym</li>
               <li>Listening to music</li>
               <li>Working on cars</li>
               <li>Playing video games</li>
            </ul>
        </main>
