            <h3>Modifying Images</h3>
            
            <!-- 1st paragraph element: Use the paragraph element below to explain the importance of using descriptive file names for image files. Use complete sentences. -->
            <p>Using descriptive file names for images makes it simpler to manage the code and files, and it provides more information on what the image is in the case it does not load.</p>
            
            <!-- 2nd paragraph element: Use the paragraph element below to identify the application you used to change the size of the image. Use a complete sentence. -->
            <p>I used Microsoft Paint to change the size of the image.</p>
            
            <!-- 3rd paragraph element: Use the paragraph element below to identify the original size of the image, in pixels. Use a complete sentence. -->
            <p>The original size of the image was 2121x1414 pixels</p>
            
            <h4>Image Before Compression</h4>
            <!-- Use image element below to insert the image before compression, html5.jpg -->
            <img src="images/html5.jpg" alt="hand writing html5 on glass" width="2121" height="1414">
            
            <!-- 4th paragraph element: Use the paragraph element below to identify the online image compressor you used to reduce the file size. What was the original image file size? What was the reduced image file size? Use complete sentences.  -->
            <p>I used compressor.io to reduce the file size. The original file size was 882kb. The reduced file size is 45kb.</p>
            
            <h4>Image After Compression</h4>
            <!-- Use image element below to insert the image after compression, html5_min.jpg -->
            <img src="images/html5_min.jpg" alt="hand writing html5 on glass" width="2121" height="1414">
            
            <!-- 5th paragraph element: Use the paragraph element below to note any visual changes that you can see between html5.jpg and html5_min.jpg -->
            <p>The compressed image is not as visually sharp as the original image</p>

                <!-- 6th paragraph element: Use the paragraph element below to provide information about the resource you used to help create your SVG image -->
