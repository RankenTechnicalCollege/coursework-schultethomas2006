    <p>Chapter 1, Apply Your Knowledge</p>

    <p> I am using Visual Studio Code as my text editor
    to complete this assignment.</p>

    <p>Chapter 1 provides an overview of webpage design
    and all of the design elements that must be taken
    into consideration when creating a webpage. Before
    you begin coding a website, you must first create a
    wireframe and site map. Next, you need to consider
    several design elements, such as graphics,
    navigation, and color. Finally, you must also plan
    for accessibility.</p>

    <p>After Chapter 1, I understand how to use a text editor
    to create an HTML page and I know some HTML elements that are
    used in making a webpage.</p>
